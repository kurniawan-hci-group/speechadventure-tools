(SAMPLE 1)
STRICKLAND: GOOD MORNING.
MARSHA IS ON HER WAY. SHE CALLED FROM THE CAR PHONE I THINK. IT SOUNDED LIKE THE CAR PHONE, TO LET US KNOW THAT SHE WOULD BE DELAYED.
I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN WITH US BEFORE.
SUZANNE CLEWELL, WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU WITH US TODAY. SUZANNE, WOULD YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU DO?
CLEWELL: YES. I'M THE COORDINATOR FOR READING LANGUAGE ARTS WITH THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHICH IS THE SUBURBAN DISTRICT SURROUNDING WASHINGTON. WE HAVE 173 SCHOOLS AND 25 ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.
IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE.
STRICKLAND: AND I'LL SKIP OVER TO ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE, BUT FOR HER, THIS IS HER FIRST MEETING, TOO, JUDITH LANGER. I THINK WE ALL KNOW HER WORK, IF WE DIDN'T KNOW HER.
JUDITH.
LANGER: HELLO. I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE.
I HAVE CAREFULLY READ AND HEARD ABOUT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THE GROUP HAS DISCUSSED UP UNTIL NOW.
I'M A PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBANY, THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK. AND I'M ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL RESEARCH CENTER ON ENGLISH LEARNING AND ACHIEVEMENT.
STRICKLAND: HER MOTHER WROTE THE STANCES.
(LAUGHTER)
KAPINUS:DOROTHY, I MIGHT ADD ALSO THAT JUDITH PROBABLY HAS MORE HISTORY WITH NAEP THAN JUST ABOUT THAT I KNOW OF, YOU KNOW, NAEP AND READING.
STRICKLAND: YES, YES. WE WILL REALLY TURN TO YOU AS A VERY IMPORTANT RESOURCE, JUDITH.
AND WE HAVE A NEW MEMBER, GLORIA LOPEZ GUTIERREZ.
AND, GLORIA, TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOURSELF.
GUTIERREZ: WELL, I'M A BILINGUAL TEACHER IN THE SAN RAFAEL CITY SCHOOLS, A SMALL DISTRICT IN MARIN COUNTY, ACTUALLY THE LARGEST DISTRICT IN MARIN COUNTY.
I'LL CHECK WHAT THE POPULATION IS THERE. OUR STUDENT POPULATION, I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY UNDER 10,000. I WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE 7,000 OR 8,000, A SMALL DISTRICT.
I'M A THIRD GRADE TEACHER. I'M A PARENT OF A SOON-TO-BE FOURTH GRADE STUDENT.
STRICKLAND: WELL, WE ALL SERVE MANY ROLES.
(LAUGHTER)
STRICKLAND: AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT, ALL THE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES.
DAVID, SOME OPENING REMARKS.
MANDEL: WELL, WE'RE HERE AND MOVING FORWARD.
(LAUGHTER)
MANDEL: AND WHEN I WROTE A NOTE THE OTHER DAY ABOUT THE NEW TEXT THAT WE HAD AND I LOOKED AT THE CALENDAR AND REALIZED THAT WE JUST HAD MET NINE DAYS BEFORE THIS NEW DOCUMENT WAS COMING OUT, I SAID, WELL, THIS IS A REALLY EVEN MORE HECTIC PACE THAN WE THOUGHT WE WERE ON, BUT A GOOD ONE.
AND MANY THANKS TO EUNICE AND MATT FOR LOTS OF HARD WORK AND FOR REALLY MAKING A BIG LEAP FORWARD AND FOR GOING FROM WHERE WE WERE IN CHICAGO IN TERMS OF TEXT TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY.
AND THERE WAS A REAL HARD ATTEMPT, BOTH TO BE FAITHFUL TO THE CONVERSATION THAT TOOK PLACE IN CHICAGO AND TO CAPTURE THE GOOD IDEAS AROUND THE TABLE AND PUT THEM INTO SOME LOGICAL ORDER THAT WOULD BE READER FRIENDLY, AND ALSO TO PUT FORWARD A COUPLE OF IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THE SET OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND THE TABLE, BUT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN RESOLVED.
AND SO SOME OF WHAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU IS A BIT PERSPECTIVE AND ANTICIPATORY ABOUT WHERE YOU MIGHT BE GOING AND AT LEAST TO SORT OF TEST THE GROUND TO SEE IF WE'VE GOT IT RECORDED RIGHT OR IF THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO DO IT OR A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO IT.
ALSO, I NOTED THAT THE PASSAGE OF THIS DOCUMENT FROM OUR OFFICE TO YOU IN SOME CASES WAS NOT AS SMOOTH AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND INCLUDING THE HOTEL CONSPIRING AGAINST US LAST NIGHT TO NOT DELIVER THIS DOCUMENT TO EUNICE AND TO DOROTHY AMONG OTHERS.
(LAUGHTER)
MANDEL: BUT I THINK WE WILL STRUGGLE FORWARD HERE.
IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT IN READING OVER THE SUMMARY OF THE LAST MEETINGS WHICH IS UNDER TAB F, I BELIEVE, WE DISCOVERED THAT WE HAD SUCH A GOOD SUMMARY OF THE MEETING THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN THE SUMMARY THAT HAVEN'T BEEN YET TRANSFERRED TO THE DOCUMENT.
AND WE ARE PREPARED TO TELL YOU WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE. THAT IS, THINGS THAT YOU DECIDED THAT WERE WELL CAPTURED IN THE SUMMARY, BUT HAVEN'T YET ALL MADE IT INTO THE DOCUMENT, BUT THAT NEED TO BE.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED THEIR ABSENCE OR NOT, BUT WE DID. AND WE WANT TO CORRECT THAT.
IN ADDITION, YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU HERE IN THE DOCUMENT A SET OF NEW TEXT THAT EUNICE FOUND, SEARCHED FOR THIS PAST WEEK IN BETWEEN WRITING, AND A SET OF PROSPECTIVE QUESTIONS THAT ONE MIGHT ASK AROUND THIS.
AND EUNICE MIGHT WANT TO SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THAT IS AND WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW THEY CAME TO BE.
AND THEN, I WOULD JUST LIKE IN CLOSING TO SAY THAT WE'VE GOT A GOOD DEAL OF WORK AHEAD OF US, EVEN THOUGH WE GOT A LOT ACCOMPLISHED.
WE HAVE A NATIONAL TEST PANEL MEETING COMING UP ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY OF THIS WEEK, WHERE DOROTHY WILL BASICALLY PROVIDE THE STATUS REPORT TO THE TEST PANEL ABOUT WHERE THINGS STAND AND SHARE WITH THEM THIS DRAFT OR SOMETHING VERY CLOSE TO IT.
OUR OBJECTIVE IS, I WOULD SAY IN THE NEXT 10 DAYS OR SO TO FIND A WAY TO GET A DRAFT OUT TO THE PUBLIC.
THAT IS TO TAKE THE CURRENT DRAFT BEFORE YOU AND REFINE IT. AND IN THAT TIME -- I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO REFINE IT BASED ON THIS CONVERSATION OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS.
BUT IN THAT TIME, TO GET ANOTHER DRAFT TO YOU TO REVIEW SO THAT THE COMMITTEE IS CLEARLY COMFORTABLE AND READY TO HAVE ITS NAME PUT ON THE DRAFT AS A DRAFT SEEKING PUBLIC COMMENTS AND CRITIQUE.
AND THEN, THAT DRAFT WILL BE THE BASIS FOR HEARINGS IN ATLANTA AND THE PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS THAT WE WANT TO BEGIN SO THAT WHEN YOU COME TO ATLANTA IN THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST, YOU WILL HAVE A RANGE OF ADVICE FROM PEOPLE IN THE READING COMMUNITY, PEOPLE IN THE BOARD OF EDUCATION COMMUNITY, FROM FOLKS IN THE MEASUREMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT THE MERITS OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO DATE.
AND THAT IF WE DO ALL THAT WELL WITH THE HELP AND PARTICIPATION FROM ALL OF YOU, WE WILL GET A LOT OF GOOD ADVICE THAT WE CAN USE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.
WE MAY GET SOME ADVICE THAT WE ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT, BUT THAT IS PART OF THE PROCESS.
AND YOU ALL HAVE THE GOOD JUDGMENT TO DECIDE WHICH ADVICE IS HELPFUL AND WHICH MAY BE LESS HELPFUL.
AND WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT YOU CAN DO THAT.
I SHOULD ALSO SAY ON THE COMMENT PROCESS THOUGH, OUR INTENTION IS BOTH TO PUT UP THE DRAFT ON A WEB SITE SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO IT THAT WAY, TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE THROUGH E-MAIL TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ON VARIOUS LISTS, TO MAIL IT TO THE FOLKS WHO WERE RECOMMENDED TO US TO DO THAT, AND TO, IN FACT, GIVE IT TO ANYONE WHO WANTS IT.
WE ALL KNOW THAT EACH OF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN NETWORKS AND A COLLECTION OF COLLEAGUES, TEACHERS, AND SCHOLARS IN THE FIELD.
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE THOSE KINDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHOM WE MIGHT OTHERWISE MISS THAT WE SORT OF WELCOME YOU TO PROVIDE US EITHER E-MAIL ADDRESSES OR REGULAR PLAIN OLD POST OFFICE ADDRESSES SO THAT WE CAN GET THIS OUT.
IT'S THE CASE THAT IF ANYONE WANTS TO DISTRIBUTE IT THEMSELVES, THAT'S FINE, TOO.
THAT WOULD HELP THE PROCESS IF YOU COULD LET US KNOW BASICALLY WHERE IT'S GOING SO WE CAN SORT OF TRACK WHO'S GETTING IT.
AND WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS DISTRIBUTED IN A BROAD RANGE OF COMMUNITIES. THEN, WE GET A COMPLETE DIVERSITY OF RESPONSES IN THE REVIEW PROCESS.
LANGER: NOW, DAVID, WILL YOU PLEASE BE ABLE TO TELL US BY E-MAIL WHEN THE DRAFTS CAN BE DISTRIBUTED? I ASSUME IT'S TOO EARLY AT THIS POINT?
MANDEL: YES. I MEAN THE NOTION IS THAT, IN FACT, THE DRAFT THAT WILL GET DISTRIBUTED IS TWO DRAFTS FROM THIS POINT BECAUSE THERE WILL BE A DRAFT THAT COMES OUT OF THIS MEETING WHICH WE WANT YOU TO REVIEW.
AND THEN, BASED ON YOUR REVIEW, THERE WILL BE A SECOND DRAFT. AND THEN, DOROTHY AND MARSHâ€¡ WILL ESTIMATE THE FINAL CALL ON IT. AND THAT WILL BE WHAT GETS DISTRIBUTED.
BUT AS SOON AS THAT IS AVAILABLE, WE WILL MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO YOU IN BOTH HARD AND ELECTRONIC VERSIONS TO DO AS YOU SEE FIT.
STRICKLAND: SO THAT WILL BE THE SAME DRAFT THAT GOES FOR THE AUGUST MEETING.
MANDEL: YES.
STRICKLAND: ALL RIGHT. SO IT WILL BE PRIOR TO AUGUST 14TH OR WHATEVER DATE IT IS.
MANDEL: WAY PRIOR.
(LAUGHTER)
STRICKLAND: WAY PRIOR, YES. WAY PRIOR.
(LAUGHTER)
VOICE: TOMORROW.
(LAUGHTER)
STRICKLAND: ANYTHING ELSE?
