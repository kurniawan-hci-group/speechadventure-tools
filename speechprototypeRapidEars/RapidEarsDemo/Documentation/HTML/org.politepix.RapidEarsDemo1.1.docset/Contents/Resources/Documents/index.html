Introduction</h1>
<p>RapidEars is a plugin for OpenEars which adds the new ability to do real time speech recognition on in-progress speech for live voice recognition on the iPhone. If your application has a need for speed and you are shipping for devices that can support more CPU overhead (we recommend that this feature is restricted to the iPhone 4 and higher), all you have to do is install the RapidEars plugin in your working OpenEars project and PocketsphinxController and OpenEarsEventsObserver will get some new methods that will let you stop waiting for pauses in speech and start evaluating immediately. It's great for games or any application that needs real time speech recognition and fast feedback. Because of the optimizations that are needed to do instant recognition on the iPhone, it does not have the accuracy rates of PocketsphinxController in the stock version of OpenEars and should be used with smaller vocabularies.</p>
<p>RapidEars can be purchased at the Politepix shop <a href="http://www.politepix.com/shop/rapidears">here</a> and we recommend thoroughly evaluating the demo version before purchasing, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.politepix.com/shop/rapidearsdemo">this shop page</a>. The installation and usage process is the same for both the demo and licensed version, but the demo times out after 3 minutes of use and can't be submitted to the App Store.</p>
<p>The best way to get started using RapidEars is to get a tutorial from the <a href="http://www.politepix.com/openears/tutorial">Politepix interactive tutorial tool</a>. Steps for getting started and more in-depth documentation are also provided on this page.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_sec"></a>
Installation</h1>
<p>How to install and use RapidEars:</p>
<p>RapidEars is a plugin for OpenEars, so it is added to an already-working OpenEars project in order to enable new OpenEars features. In these instructions we are using the OpenEars sample app as an example for adding the plugin and new features, but the steps are basically the same for any app that already has a working OpenEars installation. Please note that RapidEars requires OpenEars 1.2.1 or greater.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="http://www.politepix.com/openears">Download and try out the OpenEars distribution and try the OpenEars sample app out</a>. RapidEars is a plug-in for OpenEars that is added to an OpenEars project so you first need a known-working OpenEars app to work with. The OpenEars sample app is fine for this to get started. You can also get a complete tutorial on both creating an OpenEars app and adding RapidEars to it using the automatic customized <a href="http://www.politepix.com/openears/tutorial">tutorial</a>.</li>
<li>Open up the OpenEars Sample App in Xcode. Drag your downloaded RapidEarsDemo.framework into the OpenEars sample app project file navigator.</li>
<li>Open up the Build Settings tab of your app or OpenEarsSampleApp and find the entry "Other Linker Flags" and add the linker flag "-ObjC". Do this for debug and release builds. More explanation of this step can be seen in the <a href="http://www.politepix.com/openears/tutorial">tutorial</a> by selecting the live recognition tutorial, which will also show exactly how to use the new methods added by RapidEars.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="concept_sec"></a>
Support</h1>
<p>You can have one free email support incident with the demo version of RapidEars, and as many questions on the OpenEars plugins forums as you like. To use your free email support incident, you must register your app and a verifiable name (company name or personal name) here.</p>
<p>You can also send as many sales inquiries as you like through the contact form, and you don't need to register in order to do so, although a sales inquiry with a tech support question will be considered a support incident and we'll ask you to register in order to have it engaged.</p>
<p>Once you have completed licensing of the framework for your app, you get two more email support incidents and continued forum support. Extra email support incidents for demo and licensed versions can always be purchased at the Politepix shop. Support contracts for multiple email support incidents with Politepix can also be purchased. Licensing the framework requires giving the exact application name that the framework will be linked to, so don't purchase the license until you know the app name. Please read on for the RapidEars documentation. </p>
